## Welcome to Phinanze
Phinanze is a Windows PC application for personal finance management that can be used for tracking earnings, expenses, and generating useful reports and statistics. Interactive and easy-to-use design makes the app a convenient tool for simple personal finance management. I developed this application as a hobby project in 2019 summer and initially named it MyCost which I recently changed to Phinanze to better reflect the app's functionality.
