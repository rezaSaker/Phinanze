## Welcome to Phinanze
Phinanze is a Windows PC application for personal finance management that can be used for tracking earning and expense records, managing records with dynamic search and filter options, and option to generate useful reports and statistics. Interactive and easy-to-use design makes the app a convenient tool for simple personal finance management. I developed this application as a hobby project in 2019 summer and made minor chages whenever I had the chance to improve the app's UI and overall functionalities.
